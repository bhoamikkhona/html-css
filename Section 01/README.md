## Lessons Learned

### A High-Level Overview of Web Development

- Frontend vs. Backend Development
  - All of the code that makesup a website needs to always be written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS) since these are essentially the three core technologies that any browser can understand.
  - The process of writing HTML, CSS and JS code that the browser can understand is the process that we call frontend web development.
  - So, whenever you hear someone talking about frontend development, what they mean is developers writing the code that is displayed in a browser, which is basically the frontend of a website.
    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > Whenever the files that makeup the website are simply stored on the webserver and are then sent to the browser as they are, we say that we have a static website.
  - To write applications that are actually executed on web servers, developers use some kind of backend language like Node.js, PHP, or Python.
  - These languages take data out of a database and basically assemble that data into the final files that will then be sent to the browser as the response.
  - This whole process is called backend development because, this is basically the invisible part of a website.
  - In this situation, we say that we have a dynamic website because the website is dynamically assembled from different pieces on the server; and that happens each time that someone visits the website.
- The 3 Languages of the Frontend
  - HTML
    - Responsible for the content of the page e.g. text, images, buttons, etc.
  - CSS
    - Responsible for the presentation of that content i.e. styling, layout, etc.
  - JS
    - JavaScript is the actual programming language of the frontend.
    - It allows us to add dynamic and interactive effects to webpages.
    - We can also use it to manipulate the content or the CSS to lead data from web servers and even to build entire frontend applications, which we then call web applications.
