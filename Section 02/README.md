## Lessons Learned

### Introduction to HTML

- HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
- It is one of the core web technologies along with CSS and JS.
- HTML is a markup language that web developers can use to structure and describe the entire content of any webpage.

> [!NOTE]
>
> HTML is not a programming language.
>
> It is a markup language because we use it to describe something.
>
> In the case of HTML, we do describe content using elements.

- We have different elements that we can use to describe different types of content.
  - Paragraphs
  - Links
  - Headings
  - Images
  - Video
  - etc
- Web browsers, such as Google Chrome, essentially understand HTML code and can render it as a final website that we can see in the browser.
- Anatomy of an HTML element
  - Example: `<p>HTML is a markup language</p>`
  - HTML element is usually made up of 3 parts viz:
    - Opening tag, e.g. `<p>`
    - Content, e.g. `HTML is a markup language`
      - Content of the element could either be text or another element which we then call a child element. Some elements have no content, e.g. `<img>`.
    - Closing tag, e.g. `</p>`
